        I'm a dedicated full-stack developer with a strong foundation in data analysis and Python. My journey began as a data analyst, where I honed my skills in Python and Django to extract insights from complex datasets.
Over time, my passion for building comprehensive web applications led me to expand my expertise into full-stack development. I've become proficient in Laravel, a powerful PHP framework, and Flutter, a cross-platform UI framework.
With a solid understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies, I'm able to deliver robust and user-friendly solutions. I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer, and I'm eager to contribute my skills to innovative projects."
